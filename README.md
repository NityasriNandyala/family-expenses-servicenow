Project Title: Calculating Family Expenses Using ServiceNow

Description:
          This project aims to build a simple and efficient application on the ServiceNow platform to track and manage monthly family expenses. Users can input daily or monthly expenses categorized by type (e.g., groceries, utilities, rent, education). The system automatically calculates total expenses, compares them with a predefined budget, and generates alerts if spending exceeds limits. Key features include form-based data entry, real-time dashboards, automated notifications, and reports for financial planning. This project demonstrates how ServiceNowâ€™s low-code tools can be used for personal finance management.
